# AtmosRestore Prototype Dashboard

Welcome to the AtmosRestore Prototype Dashboard! This project is a simple and interactive web dashboard designed to visualize real-time soil sensor data collected from IoT devices. It provides an intuitive interface to monitor key soil parameters such as moisture, temperature, pH level, and salinity.

## Features

- **Real-time Gauges:** Visualize current soil conditions with dynamic gauges for moisture, temperature, pH, and salinity.
- **Trend Charts:** Track historical trends of soil parameters with interactive line charts.
- **Data Logs:** View detailed logs of sensor readings with timestamps.
- **History Section:** Access recent history readings in a clean, scrollable table.
- **Responsive Design:** A nature-inspired, clean UI with a mangrove background and smooth animations.

## Technology Stack

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend interface.
- [JustGage](https://justgage.com/) for animated gauge visualizations.
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) for interactive trend charts.
- Firebase Firestore (setup included) for real-time data storage and retrieval.
- Google Fonts (Roboto, Inter) and custom styling for a modern look.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `public/index.html` file in your favorite web browser.
